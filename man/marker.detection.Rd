\title{Detect circRNA markers
To establish a possible impact of circRNA in gene expression
we define two groups of samples defined by similarity in circRNAs expression.
K-means algorithm is used to define these two groups and then DESeq test (adj. p-value<.01) 
have been used to detect circRNA markers.}
